# CSS Lesson 05 Lab

In this lab we will practice using the box model to better understand how to style elements in HTML

## Step 1
- In `style.css` give all the elements that have a class of "box" a background color of "whitesmoke", width of "320px" and height of "320px".

Example Code:
```css
.box {
  background-color: whitesmoke;
  height: 320px;
  width: 320px;
}
```

## Step 2
- In `style.css` give all the elements that have a class of "padding" some padding of "5px"

Example Code:
```css
.padding {
  padding: 5px;
}
```

## Step 3
- In `style.css` give all the elements that have a class of "margin" some margin of "5px"

Example Code:
```css
.margin {
  margin: 5px;
}
```

## Step 4
- In `style.css` give all the elements that have a class of "border" a black border that is 2px thick.

Example Code:
```css
.border {
  border: solid black 2px;
}
```
